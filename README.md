# Hash-Tables-Ransom-Note

A kidnapper want to write a ransom note but he is worried that it will be traced back to him. He found a magazine and wants to know if he can cut out whole words from it and use them to create an untraceable replica of his ransom note. The words in his note are case-sensitive and he must use whole words available in the magazine, meaning he cannot use substrings or concatenation to create the words he needs.

Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, print "Yes" if he can replicate his ransom note exactly using whole words from the magazine; otherwise, print "No".

## Example:

Magazine words: "you and me have only one reason to remember this day",

Ransom note words: "you have only one day";

Return "Yes".
